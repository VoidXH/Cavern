By downloading, using, copying, modifying, or compiling the source code or a
build, you are accepting these terms. The source code, just like the compiled
software, is given to you for free, but without any warranty. It is not
guaranteed to work, and the developer is not responsible for any damages from
the use of the software. You are allowed to make any modifications, and release
them for free under this licence. If you release a modified version, you have to
link the VoidXH/Cavern GitHub repository as its source. You are not allowed to
sell any part of the original or the modified version. You are also not allowed
to show advertisements in the modified software. The software must be named with
a link to the creator (https://en.sbence.hu) when used in public (e.g. for
screenings) or commercially (e.g. as an API in another software), also, the
original creator's permission is required for public use (e.g. screening). If
you include these code or any part of the original version in any other project,
these terms still apply.
